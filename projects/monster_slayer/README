# Monster Slayer Game

## Overview

The "Monster Slayer Game" is a simple text-based RPG that demonstrates the use of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in game development. The game features a player character battling against a series of monsters, utilizing basic RPG mechanics such as attacking, defending, and using potions. This project serves as an example of how to structure a game using classes and OOP concepts.

## Features

- **Character Class:** Represents both the player and monsters, with attributes for health, attack power, defense power, and potions.
- **Monster Class:** Inherits from the Character class and represents different types of monsters.
- **Health Bars:** Displays health status for the player and monsters.
- **Player Actions:** The player can attack, defend, or use potions.
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Alternates turns between the player and monsters.

## Game Mechanics

- **Attack:** The player can attack a monster, dealing damage based on their attack power and the monster's defense.
- **Defend:** The player can increase their defense power.
- **Use Potion:** The player can use a potion to recover health points.
- **Monster Turn:** Monsters attack the player on their turn.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code:**
   ```sh
   g++ -o monster_slayer game.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
   ```sh
   ./monster_slayer
   ```

## Code Explanation

- **Character Class:** Contains attributes for health, attack power, defense power, and potions. Methods include `attack()`, `defend()`, `usePotion()`, and `isAlive()`.
- **Monster Class:** Inherits from `Character` and initializes with no potions.
- **`displayHealthBar()`:** Displays the health status of a character or monster using a visual health bar.
- **Player and Monster Turns:** Functions to handle player and monster actions, determining the outcome of each turn.

## Example Usage

The game will prompt the player to choose an action during their turn. The available actions are:
1. Attack
2. Defend
3. Use Potion

After the player's turn, the monster will attack if it is still alive. The game continues until either the player defeats all monsters or the player is defeated.
